# Car_Collection

A JavaFX GUI is presented to user allowing them enter details of a car. The details are used to create Car objects which are then serialised to a file and read back in when the program start back up. The user can add or remove cars from the collection.

The car details can be sorted by make and model, by year, or by mileage. The details are listed in the GUI.

A sample image of the GUI is shown below
